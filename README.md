### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience specializing in mobile and cloud-based development. 

📱 I have a strong background in cross-platform mobile and web development technologies, including React Native, React Web, and Google's Flutter. I've built numerous Android and iOS applications from scratch and optimized existing ones, always with performance and scalability in mind.

☁️ On the cloud side, I've extensively worked with Google Cloud Platform offerings such as Cloud Run, Firebase, Cloud Functions, Google Analytics, Datastore, and Firestore, focusing on building scalable and secure backend systems.

🔧 I pride myself on my ability to write clean, reusable, and maintainable code that scales across multiple projects and teams. I'm always up-to-date with the latest trends in cross-platform development ecosystems and adhere to cutting-edge security practices.

🌐 I have a deep understanding of Android and iOS SDKs, UI design principles, patterns, and best practices. I'm always ready to explore new technologies and seize new opportunities.

💡 I'm passionate, dedicated, and always keep scalability in mind, whether I'm building a new mobile application from scratch or developing a backend system for an existing application. Looking forward to contributing to and learning from the GitHub community!
